# KPM

<p class="lead">Area for the "entrances" and personal menu</p>

## When to use

TBD

## How to use

You can get the KPM in two ways:

1. (Recommended) Inject the KPM script
2. Make the HTML markup yourself

### Inject the KPM script

Under development. This method to inject KPM dinamically via a script will be available later.

## How to make your own KPM

KPM is divided into two pieces:

- [Entrances](/style/en/components/entrances)
- [Personal menu](/style/en/components/personal-menu)

TODO: add example and code
