# Principles for creating a good app at KTH

<p class="lead">Learn how do you measure a good application from usability and accessibility perspective</p>

## Do what is boring for your users

Teachers and students don't use your app because they _want_ to use it. They usually use it because they _must_ do it, which means:

- Users don't have time to learn how to use your app
- Users don't have energy to remember how to use your app
- Users don't have time to read
- Users don't expect to have fun with your app
- Users don't have time to _admire_ your app (they appreciate a well-designed, well-thought app, though)

## Create safety in their actions

Users _do_ tasks with apps, some of them are critical

- A teacher uses an app to report grades.
- A student uses an app to search an exam location for an exam that starts in one hour.

In general:

- Ensure your app gives correct information to the users.
- Before an action, explain what will happen; for important actions, ask for confirmation.
- After the action, confirm what has happened and what errors occur. Give chances to undo.
- Make it hard to users to do wrong inputs or be able to correct them

## Give users control

Your users might use several apps as part of their job:

- A teacher might use a tool for organizing a schedule, another one to present bibliography, another one to design an exam.
- A student might need to search course, check if they meet the requirements, contact the teacher, register and check the schedule using several apps.

Be sure they understand what happens all the time:

- Before users start an app, make it clear what the app does and what doesn't do.
- Offer the possibility to exit the app and return later
- Inform all the time in which step of the process are they.
- When users have finished using your app, inform what should they do next.

## Apps at KTH are tiny parts of the whole KTH

Users don't need to know where an app starts and where ends. From their perspective, they are just "at KTH".

- Users don't know that header and personal menu are different things. Even less, they don't know that are created by two different teams.
- Users don't know the difference between "KTH Search", "Search course", "Course catalogue", "About course"

That means:

- Avoid using unique artifacts (terminology, design, etc.) in your app.
- Understand where is your app, within the KTH structure.
