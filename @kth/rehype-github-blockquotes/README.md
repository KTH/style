DO NOT PUBLISH THIS PACKAGE. THIS IS A TEMPORAL SOLUTION

---

This plugin for [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) adds support for styling [Github's "Note" and "Warning" using blockquote in Markdown](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925).

This plugin is NOT meant to be published, only used internally for styling our KTH Style website.

When possible, this should be removed and replaced with [rehype-github](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-github).
