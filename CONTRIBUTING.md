# Contributing to KTH Style

Thanks for your interest in contributing to KTH Style!

## Who can contribute

At this moment we only accept contributions from people within the IT department at KTH.

## How can you contribute

This repository contains the `@kth/style` library and its documentation.

- `@kth/style` library uses technologies like Sass, JavaScript, TypeScript and React. We recommend you are familiar with them.
- The pages is written in Markdown, so this is the only requirement if you want to contribute to the content.
- The documentation also uses Sass, JavaScript, TypeScript to show the content as website. If you want to develop the website, you need some familiarity with the technologies
- There is also "meta-documents" to "document the documentation" (like this document)

For any questions, reach us in the [KTH Slack channel #vs-it-ux](https://kth-se.slack.com/archives/C06K0G9BQUE).
