# KTH Style monorepo

**WORK IN PROGRESS**. This is the Monorepo for KTH Style, the KTH's Design System.

## Structure

- `/@kth` directory contains the packages that are published in npm under the `@kth` namespace. Right now there is only one but it can be more
- `/@kth/style` is the actual KTH Style library. We haven't plan to publish more than one package but
- `/apps` directory contains applications that will not be published into npm.
- `/apps/web` contains the future KTH Style website

Find the documentation for each project in the README file located on top of them.
